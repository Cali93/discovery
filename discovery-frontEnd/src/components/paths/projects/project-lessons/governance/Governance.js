        MPH holders have the power to shape the future of the protocol.
      </p>
      <p>

        A dedicated   <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/88mph.eth">Snapshot</a> is live to enable the community of users to signal their preferences on the project developments. Also, Snapshot proposals provide 88mph community members a deep understanding of the protocols offered.
      </p>
      <p>
        The governance process of 88mph works by having users signal their preferences with their MPH tokens on various proposals ranging from **protocol parameters to smart ways of using the capital assets stored in the treasury for creating new incentives, capitalization, and at the end growth. The 88mph community can vote on 8IP - 88mph Improvement Protocol - proposals using their staked MPH as their vote's weighting.
