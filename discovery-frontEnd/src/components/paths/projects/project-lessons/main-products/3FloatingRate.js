      <p>
        The Floating-Rate Bond (FRB) allows users to fund the debt created by the Fixed-Interest Rate Bonds (FIRB). The debt is the fixed-interest rate promised to FIRB holders. You will earn the floating-interest rate offered by the underlying protocol (Compound, Aave, etc, used to generate the FIRB's yield) on the debt-funded and the FIRB initial deposit. Also, you'll earn some MPH rewards as an FRB holder.
